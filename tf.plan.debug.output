Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform planned the following actions, but then encountered a problem:

  # terraform_data.known_data will be created
  + resource "terraform_data" "known_data" {
      + id     = (known after apply)
      + input  = "1"
      + output = (known after apply)
    }

  # module.docs.data.kubectl_file_documents.docs will be read during apply
  # (depends on a resource or a module with changes pending)
 <= data "kubectl_file_documents" "docs" {
      + content   = <<-EOT
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: docs
            metadata:
              name: doc1
            ---
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: docs
            metadata:
              name: doc2
        EOT
      + documents = (known after apply)
      + id        = (known after apply)
      + manifests = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Error: Invalid count argument

  on modules/docs/main.tf line 26, in resource "kubectl_manifest" "docs":
  26:   count     = length(data.kubectl_file_documents.docs.documents)

The "count" value depends on resource attributes that cannot be determined
until apply, so Terraform cannot predict how many instances will be created.
To work around this, use the -target argument to first apply only the
resources that the count depends on.
